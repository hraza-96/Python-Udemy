# Python-Udemy

I have completed the "Introduction to Programming Using Python" course on Udemy, where I learned the fundamentals of Python programming, including variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures. This course helped me develop problem-solving skills and gain hands-on experience in coding, which I have applied to create small projects and solve real-world problems. It has laid a strong foundation for my journey in programming and data analysis.

Feel free to explore the code repositories and projects created during the course!
